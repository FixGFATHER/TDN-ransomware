        <h1>Disclaimer and Safety Guidelines</h1>
        
        <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
        
        <h3>Educational Purpose</h3>
        <p>This software is provided strictly for educational and research purposes only. It is designed to demonstrate the mechanics of file encryption and decryption typically used by ransomware, with the goal of educating users about the risks and workings of such malicious software. Under no circumstances should this software be used for any illegal or malicious activities.</p>
        
        <h3>No Malicious Use</h3>
        <p>By downloading, accessing, or using this software, you agree to use it solely for educational purposes and in a lawful manner. You must not use this software to cause harm, disrupt services, or carry out any unauthorized or illegal activities. The creators of this software explicitly prohibit the use of this software for any form of cybercrime, including but not limited to, unauthorized access to computer systems, data theft, or any form of ransomware attack.</p>
        
        <h3>No Liability</h3>
        <p>The creators of this software disclaim any and all liability for any damages, losses, or legal consequences that may arise from the use or misuse of this software. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of data, damage to computer systems, and legal actions taken against the user. By using this software, you accept full responsibility for any consequences that result from its use.</p>
        
        <h3>Indemnification</h3>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the creators of this software, their affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use or misuse of the software, including any breach of this agreement.</p>
        
        <h2>Safety Guidelines</h2>
        
        <h3>Virtual Environment</h3>
        <p>To ensure the safe use of this software, it must be run in a controlled and isolated environment, such as a virtual machine or a sandbox environment. This is to prevent any unintended damage to your primary operating system or data. Do not run this software on any system that contains valuable or sensitive data.</p>
        
        <h3>Backup Important Data</h3>
        <p>Before running this software, ensure that all important data is backed up to an external storage device or cloud service. This precaution is necessary to avoid any potential loss of data due to the encryption process demonstrated by the software.</p>
        
        <h3>Disable Network Access</h3>
        <p>When using this software, it is recommended to disable network access to the virtual environment or sandbox. This will prevent the software from inadvertently spreading or causing network-based issues.</p>
        
        <h3>Antivirus and Anti-Malware Measures</h3>
        <p>Be aware that this software simulates ransomware behavior, which may trigger antivirus or anti-malware programs. It is advisable to temporarily disable such programs in the controlled environment while running the demonstration. However, ensure these protections are re-enabled once the demonstration is complete.</p>
        
        <h3>No Real-World Application</h3>
        <p>This software should not be used in any real-world application outside of controlled, educational environments. Its purpose is solely to provide insight into the mechanics of ransomware, not to serve as a tool for any practical use.</p>
        
        <h3>Responsible Disclosure</h3>
        <p>If you discover any vulnerabilities or issues while using this software, please practice responsible disclosure. Report any findings to the appropriate parties or the software’s repository maintainers to ensure that potential security issues can be addressed in a timely and responsible manner.</p>
        
        <h2>Acknowledgment of Risks</h2>
        <p>By using this software, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks involved in running ransomware simulations, even in controlled environments. You agree to take all necessary precautions to mitigate these risks and to use the software in a manner that is safe, ethical, and lawful.</p>
        
        <h2>Amendments</h2>
        <p>The maintainers of this software reserve the right to amend or update this disclaimer and safety guidelines at any time without prior notice. It is the user’s responsibility to review these terms periodically to ensure compliance. This software is adapted from an open-source project and is provided for educational purposes only. Neither the original creator nor the current maintainers are responsible for any misuse of this software.</p>
        
        <h2>Contact Information</h2>
        <p>For any questions, concerns, or further information regarding the use of this software, please contact the repository maintainers or the creators directly through the appropriate channels provided in the repository.</p>
